## How It Works?

- The `binaryDonusturme` function is used to convert a character into binary form. It achieves this by shifting each bit of the character to the right and applying a bitwise AND operation to obtain its binary form.
- The `metniBinaryDon` function takes a text and calls the `binaryDonusturme` function to compute the binary form of each character by splitting the text into characters.
- The `main` function prompts the user to enter a text, sends this text to the `metniBinaryDon` function, and prints the results to the screen.
